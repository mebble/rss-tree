## Development Requirements

- node and npm
- [netlify cli installed globally](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/)

## Project Scaffolding

Steps:

```
netlify init
netlify functions:create --name <func-name>
```

## Local Development

```
npm install
cp .env.sample .env  # Put all environment variables here
netlify functions:serve
```

### Testing

Automated tests:

```
npm run test
```

Manual tests:

```bash
# when caching with last-modified header
curl 'http://<host>/.netlify/functions/<func>' -Is | grep -i 'last-modified'
curl 'http://<host>/.netlify/functions/<func>' -H 'If-Modified-Since: <last-modified>' -I

# when caching with etag header
curl 'http://<host>/.netlify/functions/<func>' -Is | grep -i 'etag'
curl 'http://<host>/.netlify/functions/<func>' -H 'If-None-Match: "<etag>"' -I
```

### Debugger

Put a `debugger` statement whereever you want it. Then:

Run the debugger with tests:

```
npm run test:debugger
```

Run the debugger when running functions locally:

```
NODE_OPTIONS="--inspect" netlify functions:serve
```
